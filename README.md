## Hi, I'm Ennio

🇮🇹 I'm a Computer Science student from Italy, also working as a developer for  platforms.

👨🏻‍💻 I work proficiently with Swift and SwiftUI, and I also happen to write some Kotlin (Multiplatform) code.

📱 In the past I got my hands dirty with
- Java, C++, Qt for some academic projects
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a couple of websites
- TypeScript to develop an Obsidian extension downloaded by more than 7000(!) users

but then I fell in love with mobile apps development and still didn't look back!

🪁 I am currently building an air quality native app for iOS on the side.
